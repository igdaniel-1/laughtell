Probabilist Map Grapher for One Piece's Laugh Tell Location


Premise: When 4 points are found, two lines can be drawn where the northmost and southmost points are connected and the east and westmost points are connected. Where those two lines insect lies a fifth point. Given the location of 3 of the initial 4 points, could you guess the location of the fifth with any accuracy? I'm checking as we speak.
